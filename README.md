### Setting Up the Conda Environment

To create a Conda environment with the same dependencies as I did:

```bash
conda env create --file labenv.yml
conda activate lab3
```

### Small HeadsUp 

I modified our code into function calls in case we have to reuse our pipeline. Also added a mean function. 
Your data peforms better on the mean of all 8 channels, just run the code & you'll see.
